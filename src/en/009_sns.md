to them

### What is Pub/Sub?

Publish-Subscribe pattern commonly implemented in
**messaging systems**. In a pub/sub system the sender of
messages ( **publishers** ) do not send their messages directly
to receivers. They instead send their messages to an
<span class="text-red">**event bus**</span>. The event bus
categorizes their messages into groups. Then receivers of
messages ( **subscribers** ) subscribe to these groups.
Whenever new messages appear within their subscription the
messages are immediately delivered to them.

- Publisher have no knowledge of who their subscribers are
- Subscribers do **not pull** for messages
- Messages are instead automatically and immediately
<span class="text-red">**pushed**</span> to subscribers
- Messages and events are interchangeable terms in pub/sub  

## SNS Topics

**Topics** allow you to group multiple subscriptions together.

A topic is able to deliver to multiple protocols at once, eg.
Email, text message, http/s

When topics deliver messages to subscribers it will automatically
format your message according to the subscriber's chosen protocol

You can encrypt Topics via **KMS**

**Publishers don't care about the subscribers protocol.**

**Subscribers listen for incoming messages.**

## SNS Subscriptions

A subscription can only subscribe to one protocol and one topic

The following protocols:

- **HTTP and HTTPS**
  - Create webhooks into your web-application
- **Email**
  - Good for internal email notifications
  ( only supports **plain text**)
- **Email-JSON**
  - Sends you json via email
- **Amazon SQS**
  - Place SNS message into SQS queue
- **AWS Lambda**
  - Triggers a lambda function
- **SMS**
  - Send a text message
- **Platform Application Endpoint**
  - Mobile Push

## Application As Subscriber

Send push notification messages directly to apps on
<span class="text-red">**mobile devices**</span>

Push notification messages sent to a mobile endpoint can
appear in the mobile app as message alerts, badge, updates,
or even sound alerts
