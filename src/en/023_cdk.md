# Cloud Developer Kit ( CDK )

Write Infrastructure as Code ( IaC ) using an
imperative paradigm with your favorite language

## Introduction

### What is Transpiler ?

A transpiler turns one source code into
another. CDK transpilers into CloudFormation
templates

### Imperative Infrastructure ( CDK )

Its implicit what resources will be created in
the end state. More flexible, less certain,
write less

Eg. I want a EC2 instance, you fill in all the
other details

### Declarative Infrastructure ( CloudFormation )

Its explicit what resources will be created in the
end state. Less flexible, very certain,
write more

Eg. I want a EC2 instance and I have to tell you
exactly every detail

CDK was first available only using **Typescript**
and is now available in multiple language

- JS, TS ( Node JS >= 10.3.0 )
- Python ( Python >= 3.6 )
- Java ( Java >= 8 and Maven >= 3.5.4 )
- .NET ( .NET Core >= 3.0 )

CDK'S API may yet to have implemented APIs to every
AWS resource available in CloudFormation

TS would likely have tho most available APIs
implemented and other languages would work to
catch up to Typescript
