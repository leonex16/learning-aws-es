# Key Management Service ( KMS )

Create and manage **encryption keys**
Use with a variety of AWS services and
in your applications

## Introduction

KMS makes it easy for you to
<span class="text-red">**create,
control and rotate encryption keys**</span> used to encrypt
your data on AWS

KMS is a
<span class="text-red">**multi-tenant**</span>
Hardware Security Module ( HSM )

Most AWS services can just

1. Checkbox on Encryption
2. And then choose a KMS key

KMS can be used with **CloudTrail** to audit access history

## KMS integrates with many AWS Services

### What is Hardware Security Module ( HSM )?

- Hardware that is specialized for storing your encryption keys
- Its designed to be tamper-proof
- It stores keys in-memory, so they are never written to disk

### What is Multi-tenant?

Multi-tenant means **that multiple customers are utilizing
the same piece of hardware**. Customers are isolated from each
other virtually. If one customer used the entire pieces of
Hardware ( dedicated ) that would be called single-tenant

**CloudHSM** is a single-tenant HSM which gives you full control.
A dedicated HSM means you can meet stricter compliance
<span class="text-red">**FIPS 140-2 Level 3**</span>
KMS is only
<span class="text-red">**FIPS 140-2 Level 2**</span>

### What is Encryption?

The process of encoding a message or information in such a way
that only authorized parties can access it and those
who are not authorized cannot

### What are Cryptographic Keys ( data keys )?

<span class="text-red">**A string of data**</span> that is
used to lock or unlock cryptographic functions, including
**authentication**, **authorization** and **encryption**

### What is a Master Key?

Stored in **secure hardware**. Master keys are used to encrypt
all other keys on a system

### What is Envelope Encryption?

A key used to encrypt another key

## Customer Master Key ( CMK )

Customer master keys are the primare resources in AWS KMS.
A **customer master key** ( CMK ) is a
<span class="text-red">**logical representation**</span>
of a master key

The CMK includes metadata, such as:

- Key ID
- Creation Date
- Description
- Key State

The CMK also contains the key material used to:

- Encrypt
- Decrypt

AWS KMS supports **symmetric** and **asymmetric** CMKs

### Symmetric Key

A 256-bit key that is used for encryption and decryption

**Uses One Key.**

### Asymmetric Key

An RSA key pair that is used for encryption and decryption or
signing and verification ( but not both )

**Uses Two Keys. Eg. Public and Private.**

## KMS - AWS CLI

You can perform many KMS actions through the AWS CLI.
It's worth mentioning some of these API commands since they
you may appear on the exam

|                                   |                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`aws kms create-key`**          | Creates a unique customer managed CMK in your AWS account and region                                                                                                       |
| **`aws kms encrypt`**             | Encrypts plaintext into cyphertext by using a CMK                                                                                                                          |
| **`aws kms decrypt`**             | Decrypts cyphertext that was encrypted by a CMK                                                                                                                            |
| **`aws kms re-encrypt`**          | Decrypts cyphertext and then re-encrypt it within AWS KMS, Manually rotate a CMK; Change the CMK that protects a cyphertext; Change the encryption context of a cyphertext |
| **`aws kms enable-key-rotation`** | Enables automatic rotation of the key material for the specified symmetric CMK. You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account                      |

## Cheat Sheet

- **Key Management Service ( KMS )** creates and manages encryption
keys for a variety of AWS services or for your apps
- KMS can be used with CloudTrail to audit keys access history
- KMS has the ability to automatically rotate out your keys
ever year with no need to re-encrypt
- **Customer master keys ( CMKs )** are the primary resource
in KMS
- KMS is a multi-tenant HSM, multi-tenant means you are
sharing the hardware with multiple customers
- Hardware Security Module ( HSM ) is a specialized hardware
for storing your keys and is tamper-proof
- **KMS** is up to
<span class="text-red">**FIPS 140-2 Level 2**</span>
compliant

- KMS stores Master Keys ( not data keys )
- Master Keys are used to encrypt data keys which is called
**Envelope Encryption**
- KMS supports two types of keys **symmetric** and **asymmetric**
  - **Symmetric** is a single key using 256 bit encryption
    - S3 bucket AES-256
  - **Asymmetric** uses two keys
    - Pair public and private keys
- Important KMS APIs to remember:
  - **`aws kms create-key`** - Creates a key
  - **`aws kms encrypt`** - Encrypts a key
  - **`aws kms decrypt`** - Decrypts a key
  - **`aws kms re-encrypt`** - Re-encrypts a key
  - **`aws kms enable-key-rotation`** - Turn on
  automatic key rotation ( only for symmetric keys )
